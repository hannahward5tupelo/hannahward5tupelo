				<h3>About Hannah</h3>
				<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" src="uploads/about_04.png" alt=""
					class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="30%" height="30%" data-no-retina>

				<p class="lead">Hannah has lived in Ward 5 (east Tupelo) for virtually her entire life. The community of
					east Tupelo is well-known to her, and it is near and dear to her heart. Hannah got her start right
					here in Ward 5 at Lawhon Elementary.</p>

				<br>
				<p class="lead">Hannah's mother Bonnie served as an early role model on the importance of hard work,
					persistence, and taking care of family. Hannah learned first-hand about the experience of a working
					class, single parent family. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">Hannah graduated from Tupelo High School, attended Northeast Mississippi Community
					College, and obtained a bachelor’s degree in journalism (<i>cum laude</i>) from the University of
					Mississippi. Determined to put the education, experience, and most importantly the drive to give
					back that she learned during her up-bringing in Tupelo, Hannah applied and was accepted into federal
					service with the United States Peace Corps. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">In the Peace Corps, Hannah spent 27 months in Mongolia. This time included living with a
					host family, intensive Mongolian language (монгол хэл) training, and two years working as an English
					instructor at Gazarchin University in the capital Ulaanbaatar. Hannah helped shape the lives of
					numerous young professionals in Ulaanbaatar through her teaching, mentoring, and peer training. She
					also coordinated and collaborated on projects with other Peace Corps members, international NGOs,
					and Mongolian governmental agencies. During her service in Mongolia, she was able to share the
					Tupelo spirit which has had lasting impact to this day.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">Upon returning to the United States, Hannah received a Peace Corps Fellowship and
					entered graduate school at the University of New Orleans where she obtained a Master’s in public
					administration. Her experience there centered on non-profit administration, preparedness and
					response, and civic engagement and organization. When she completed this program, Hannah’s goal was
					to return to Tupelo to give back to the community that had given her so much. Since then, she has
					been involved in numerous projects and organizations within the local community. </p>
				<span id="dots"></span><span id="more">
					<br>
					<p class="lead">Hannah began working as a grant administrator at a local non-profit for homeless
						prevention and outreach, where she helped to remove barriers to education, housing, employment,
						healthcare, and social services for families and individuals that were homeless or at-risk for
						homelessness. During this time, Hannah built professional working relationships with a variety
						of community stakeholders from local charities and churches to mental health and substance abuse
						professionals.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead">In 2019, Hannah became the director of the Mississippi Balance of State Continuum of
						Care. Continuums of Care are a nation-wide network of coalitions that are mandated and supported
						by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In this role, she manages a 5 region,
						71-county coalition that works to address and alleviate homelessness throughout the state. She
						works with professionals and community leaders across the state on a regular basis. Through this
						opportunity, Hannah has been able to take the collaborative partnership and coalition-building
						skills she developed in Tupelo and implement them state-wide.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead">Hannah currently serves as the chair-person of the City of Tupelo Homeless Task
						Force and is a board member of the Tupelo-Lee County Hunger Coalition, Emergency Food and
						Shelter Board, and the City of Tupelo Community Outreach Committee. She has attended summits on
						emergency preparedness hosted by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA). </p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead">Hannah continued this record of public service as director of Saints’ Brew Community
						Breakfast Program. Saints’ Brew provides a free hot breakfast to any person in need, year-round,
						five days a week. In October 2019, Saints’ Brew Community Breakfast Program surpassed a
						monumental milestone: 200,000 meals served. In this role, Hannah has secured additional grant
						funding, coordinated and trained volunteers, and has overseen the safe continuation of the
						Saints’ Brew program even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic and the
						logistical hurdles, Saints’ Brew is still serving almost 1,500 meals per month.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead">Hannah works tirelessly to advocate on behalf of Tupelo and its citizens. She has
						organized job fairs, seminars, conferences, voter registration drives, and assisted with
						countless community events. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead">Hannah believes in community engagement, public safety, education, affordable
						quality housing, employment opportunities, and helping others in the spirit of service. </p>

				<h3>Issues & Plans</h3>
				<p class="lead">Ward 5 represents a solid mix of commercial and residential. We are home to several
					major employers in the manufacturing and transportation industries as well as numerous family-owned
					small businesses. Ward 5 is a diverse community with working class roots. We have much to be proud
					of: Elvis Presley's stomping grounds, a rich educational foundation (Ole Miss Tupelo, the ICC
					Student Service Center, and the high-performing Lawhon Elementary), and two of the best city parks
					in Mississippi: Veterans Park and the Elvis Presley birthplace park. "The Birthplace" is visited by
					over 100,000 people each year - one of the top tourist destinations in the entire state.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">I believe that this position is about service. As a city councilwoman, I serve on your
					behalf. I will serve all citizens of Ward 5 and Tupelo with integrity. I will work diligently to
					address the unique challenges and opportunities representing our slice of Tupelo. Finally, I pledge
					to always be open, transparent, and available to all of my constitutents.

						<h4>HOUSING</h4>
						<p>Despite the economic successes that Tupelo has seen in recent years, housing availability
							remains a major issue affecting Tupelo residents. Housing is both in short supply and
							increasingly out of reach for working people and families in Tupelo. As your city
							councilwoman, I will work to protect and produce housing for all incomes and economic
							backgrounds. This work will be accomplished with an emphasis on working with property
							developers, non-profit organizations, governmental agencies, and public-private
							partnerships.</p>
						<br>
						<p> Neighborhoods are important both historically and economically for growing cities like
							Tupelo. Revitalization efforts are needed in many areas of the city, but they must be done
							intelligently and thoughtfully. </p>
					</div><!-- end issue -->

					<div class="issuse-wrap clearfix">

						<h4>ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY</h4>
						<p>I believe that economic opportunities means spurring growth both of the local economy but
							also the spirit of Tupelo. As a city councilwoman, my mission would be to add new employment
							opportunities at every education and income level, and to empower existing small business
							owners to grow and expand their businesses. This means fostering opportunities for new
							business both big and small, with special emphasis on diversity in product, service, and
							ownership.

						</p>

						<h4>COVID-19 RECOVERY</h4>
						<p>My goal as a city councilwoman would be to help our community and local economy recover from
							COVID-19. We need to connect our citizens, businesses, and schools to the resources they
							need in order to reopen after the pandemic has passed. My experience as a public
							administrator includes first-hand knowledge of the programs (SBA, ESG, ERA, PPP, etc.) and
							processes that our city needs to undertake in order to fully reopen both safely and
							effectively.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the ability of many families to put enough food
							on the table or to pay rent on time. People have lost jobs, had their hours cut, and have
							stressed about how they would make ends meet. I believe that the City should work to assist
							those in need. Doing so is not only the right thing to do, but it also provide a much-needed
							boost to our local economy.</p>
